    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  
    <h2><em>My Introduction</em></h2>
    <p>I worked as a freelance designer for three years in my country. Now, it is my fifth month<sup>th</sup> here. I have made many friends, but unlike when I was studying for my undergraduate degree (a <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</abbr>) in other countries, these friends in the school here come from various age groups.</p>

    <h2><em>My Recent Updates</em></h2>
    <p>I am from China, on the other side of the Earth. The experience of studying across the Pacific and the cold winters here initially made it difficult for my body to adapt â€” I caught a severe flu. But I think I will recover soon because I can't wait to enjoy the outdoor activities in Canada's winter.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Quote</h2>
