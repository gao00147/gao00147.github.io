            <p>
                I worked as a freelance designer for three years in my home country. Now, it has been five months since I arrived here. I have made many friends, but unlike when I was studying for my undergraduate degree (a <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</abbr>) in other countries, the friends I have made here come from various age groups.

            <p>
                I am from China, on the other side of the Earth. The experience of studying across the Pacific and the cold winters here initially made it difficult for my body to adaptâ€”I caught a severe flu. But I think I will recover soon because I can't wait to enjoy the outdoor activities during Canada's winter.
